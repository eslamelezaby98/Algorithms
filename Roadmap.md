### Chapter 1:

---

- you will learn your first practical algorithms (binary search).
- analyze the speed of an algorithms using Big O notation.

### Chapter 2:

---

- You will learn about two fundamental data structure (Arrays and Linked lists).
- they're used to make advanced data structure like hash tables (chapter 5).

### Chapter 3:

---

- you will learn about recursion.

**The rest of the book presents algorithms with broad application:**

- problem-solving techniques.
- hash tables
- graph  algorithms
- k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
